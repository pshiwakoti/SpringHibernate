The project is written in Spring MVC framework. It has service layer, DAO layer, Models layer, and UI. The project also publishes REST API for consumption. You may use REST Client such as POSTMAN for api consumption. src/resources folder has jdbc configurations. You may edit it according to your database settings. I have used MYSQL in this project. Also, It is a Maven project. See pom.xml for dependencies. Spring configuration file is spring-servlet.xml. Web.xml describes the usage of DispatcherServlet (typical Spring MVC). Explore the target folder for war file. You may simply download this war file and deploy it in your tomcat or any other servlet container. Make sure your jdbc.properties file matches with your database configurations.
